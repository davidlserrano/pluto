# Pluto
Concept: Incremental clicker space themed game possibly with storyline.

To open up game download all files in a folder and open index.html with Google Chrome. Cross browser support to come.

Current bugs: Depending on screen/window size object layout might come out a bit weird. Can somewhat be fixed by zooming out in browser.
